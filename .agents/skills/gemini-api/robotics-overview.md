Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 is a vision-language model (VLM) that brings Gemini's agentic capabilities to robotics. It's designed for advanced reasoning in the physical world, allowing robots to interpret complex visual data, perform spatial reasoning, and plan actions from natural language commands.
Note that if you were using Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, you can start using the 1.6 model by replacing the model name from model="gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview" to model="gemini-robotics-er-1.6-preview" in the API call.
Key features and benefits:
- Enhanced autonomy: Robots can reason, adapt, and respond to changes in open-ended environments.
- Natural language interaction: Makes robots easier to use by enabling complex task assignments using natural language.
- Task orchestration: Deconstructs natural language commands into subtasks and integrates with existing robot controllers and behaviors to complete long-horizon tasks.
- Versatile capabilities: Locates and identifies objects, understands object relationships, plans grasps and trajectories, and interprets dynamic scenes.
This document describes what the model does and takes you through several examples that highlight the model's agentic capabilities.
If you want to jump right in, you can try out the model in Google AI Studio.

## Safety
While Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 was built with safety in mind, it is your responsibility to maintain a safe environment around the robot. Generative AI models can make mistakes, and physical robots can cause damage. Safety is a priority, and making generative AI models safe when used with real-world robotics is an active and critical area of our research. To learn more, visit the Google DeepMind robotics safety page .
## Getting started: Finding objects in a scene
The following example demonstrates a common robotics use case. It shows how to pass an image and a text prompt to the model using the generateContent method to get a list of identified objects with their corresponding 2D points. The model returns points for items it identified in an image, returning their normalized 2D coordinates and labels.
You can use this output with a robotics API or call a vision-language-action (VLA) model or any other third-party user-defined functions to generate actions for a robot to perform.

## How it works
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 allows your robots to contextualize and work in the physical world using spatial understanding. It takes image/video/audio input and natural language prompts to:
- Understand objects and scene context : Identifies objects, and reasons about their relationship to the scene, including their affordances.
- Understand task instructions : Interprets tasks given in natural language, like "find the banana".
- Reason spatially and temporally : Understand sequences of actions and how objects interact with a scene over time.
- Provide structured output : Returns coordinates (points or bounding boxes) representing object locations.
This enables robots to "see" and "understand" their environment programmatically.
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 is also agentic, which means it can break down complex tasks (like "put the apple in the bowl") into sub-tasks to orchestrate long horizon tasks:
- Sequencing subtasks : Decomposes commands into a logical sequence of steps.
- Function calls/Code execution : Executes steps by calling your existing robot functions/tools or executing generated code.
Read more about how function calling with Gemini works on the Function Calling page .
### Using the thinking budget with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 has a flexible thinking budget that gives you control over latency versus accuracy tradeoffs. For spatial understanding tasks like object detection, the model can achieve high performance with a small thinking budget. More complex reasoning tasks like counting and weight estimation benefit from a larger thinking budget. This lets you balance the need for low-latency responses with high-accuracy results for more challenging tasks.
To learn more about thinking budgets, see the Thinking core capabilities page.
## Standard spatial reasoning
The following examples demonstrate tasks for robotic perception and spatial reasoning using natural language prompts, ranging from pointing and finding objects in an image to planning trajectories. For simplicity, the code snippets in these examples have been reduced to show only the prompt and the call to the generate_content API.
The full runnable code as well as additional examples can be found in the Robotics cookbook .
### Pointing to objects
Pointing and finding objects in images or video frames is a common use case for vision-and-language models (VLMs) in robotics. The following example asks the model to find specific objects within an image and return their coordinates.
```

    label returned should be an identifying name for the object detected.

    The answer should follow the json format:

    [
{{
"point":

}}

Use the following prompt to request the model to interpret abstract categories like "fruit" instead of specific objects and locate all instances in the image.
```
prompt
 
=
 
f
"""

        Get all points for fruit. The label returned should be an identifying

        name for the object detected.

        [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000."""
```
Visit the image understanding page for other image processing techniques.
### Tracking objects in a video
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 can also analyze video frames to track objects over time. See Video inputs for a list of supported video formats.
The following is the base prompt used to find specific objects in each frame that the model analyzes:
```
# Define the objects to find

queries
 
=
 
[

    
"pen (on desk)"
,

    
"pen (in robot hand)"
,

    
"laptop (opened)"
,

    
"laptop (closed)"
,

]

base_prompt
 
=
 
f
"""

  Point to the following objects in the provided image: 
{
', '
.
join
(
queries
)
}
.

  The answer should follow the json format:

  [
{{
"point": 
, "label": 
}}
, ...].

  The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.

  If no objects are found, return an empty JSON list [].

  """
```
The output shows a pen and laptop being tracked across the video frames.
For the full runnable code, see the Robotics cookbook .
### Object detection and bounding boxes
Beyond single points, the model can also return 2D bounding boxes, providing a rectangular region enclosing an object.
This example requests 2D bounding boxes for identifiable objects on a table. The model is instructed to limit the output to 25 objects and to name multiple instances uniquely.
```

      unique characteristic (colors, size, position, unique characteristics, etc..).

      The format should be as follows: [{"box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax],

      "label": <label for the object>}] normalized to 0-1000. The values in

### Trajectories
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 can generate sequences of points that define a trajectory, useful for guiding robot movement.
This example requests a trajectory to move a red pen to an organizer, including the starting point and a series of intermediate points.

## Agentic capabilities
The following examples demonstrate advanced robotic reasoning using the model's agentic capabilities, specifically code execution . In these scenarios, the model can decide to write and execute Python code to manipulate images (such as zooming in, cropping, or rotating) to resolve ambiguities or improve precision before answering.
### Object detection (Zoom and crop)
The following example demonstrates how to use code execution to zoom and crop an image for a clearer view when detecting objects and returning bounding boxes.

boxes drawn on it to the API caller as a part of your process.

### Calling a custom robot API
This example demonstrates task orchestration with a custom robot API. It introduces a mock API designed for a pick-and-place operation. The task is to pick up a blue block and place it in an orange bowl:
Similar to the other examples on this page, the full runnable code is available in the Robotics cookbook .
First step is to locate both of the items with the following prompt:
```
prompt
 
=
 
"""

            Locate and point to the blue block and the orange bowl. The label

            returned should be an identifying name for the object detected.

            The answer should follow the json format: [{"point": <point>, "label": <label1>}, ...].

            The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.

          """
```
The model response includes the normalized coordinates of the block and the bowl:
```
[

  
{
"point"
:
 
[
389
,
 
252
],
 
"label"
:

{
"point"
:
 
[
727
,
 
659
],
 
"label"
:
 
"blue block"
}

]
```
This example uses the following mock robot API:
```
def
 
move
(
x
,
 
y
,
 
high
):

  
print
(
f
"moving to coordinates:

if
 
opened
 
else
 
"Closing gripper"
)

def
 
returnToOrigin
():

  
print
(
"Returning to origin pose"
)
```
The next step is calling a sequence of API functions with the necessary logic to execute the action. The following prompt includes a description of the robot API that the model should use when orchestrating this task.
```
prompt
 
=
 
f
"""

    You are a robotic arm with six degrees-of-freedom. You have the

    following functions available to you:

    def move(x, y, high):

      # moves the arm to the given coordinates. The boolean value 'high' set

      to True means the robot arm should be lifted above the scene for

      avoiding obstacles during motion. 'high' set to False means the robot

      arm should have the gripper placed on the surface for interacting with

      objects.

    def setGripperState(opened):

      # Opens the gripper if opened set to true, otherwise closes the gripper

    def returnToOrigin():

      # Returns the robot to an initial state. Should be called as a cleanup

      operation.

    The origin point for calculating the moves is at normalized point

    y=
{
robot_origin_y
}
, x=
{
robot_origin_x
}
. Use this as the new (0,0) for

    calculating moves, allowing x and y to be negative.

    Perform a pick and place operation where you pick up the blue block at

    normalized coordinates (
{
block_x
}
, 
{
block_y
}
) (relative coordinates:

    
{
block_relative_x

    (relative coordinates:

}
).

    Provide the sequence of function calls as a JSON list of objects, where

    each object has a "function" key (the function name) and an "args" key

    (a list of arguments for the function).

    Also, include your reasoning before the JSON output.

    For example:

    Reasoning: To pick up the block, I will first move the arm to a high

    position above the block, open the gripper, move down to the block,

    close the gripper, lift the arm, move to a high position above the bowl,

    move down to the bowl, open the gripper, and then lift the arm back to

    a high position.

"""
```
The following shows a possible output of the model based on the prompt and the mock robot API. The output includes the model thinking process and the tasks that it planned out as a result. It also shows the output of the robot function calls that the model sequenced together.
```
Reasoning: To perform the pick and place operation, I will first move the
robotic arm to a high position above the blue block to ensure clearance. Then, I
will open the gripper in preparation for grasping. Next, I will lower the arm to
the surface level to position the gripper around the block and close the gripper
to secure it. After picking up the block, I will lift the arm to clear the
surface and move towards the orange bowl, maintaining a high position to avoid
collisions. Once positioned above the bowl, I will lower the arm to place the
block inside. I will then open the gripper to release the block. Finally, I will
lift the arm out of the bowl and call `returnToOrigin` to reset the robot's
state.

## Best practices
To optimize the performance and accuracy of your robotics applications, it's crucial to understand how to interact with the Gemini model effectively. This section outlines best practices and key strategies for crafting prompts, handling visual data, and structuring tasks to achieve the most reliable results.
1. Use clear and simple language. Embrace natural language : The Gemini model is designed to comprehend natural, conversational language. Structure your prompts in a way that is semantically clear and mirrors how a person would naturally give instructions. Use everyday terminology : Opt for common, everyday language over technical or specialized jargon. If the model is not responding as expected to a particular term, try rephrasing it with a more common synonym.
2. Optimize the visual input. Zoom in for detail : When dealing with objects that are small or difficult to discern in a wider shot, use a bounding box function to isolate the object of interest. You can then crop the image to this selection and send the new, focused image to the model for a more detailed analysis. Experiment with lighting and color : The model's perception can be affected by challenging lighting conditions and poor color contrast.
3. Break down complex problems into smaller steps. By addressing each smaller step individually, you can guide the model to a more precise and successful outcome.
4. Improve accuracy through consensus. For tasks that require a high degree of precision, you can query the model multiple times with the same prompt. By averaging the returned results, you can arrive at a "consensus" that is often more accurate and reliable.
## Limitations
Consider the following limitations when developing with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6:
- Preview status: The model is currently in Preview . APIs and capabilities may change, and it may not be suitable for production-critical applications without thorough testing.
- Latency: Complex queries, high-resolution inputs, or extensive thinking_budget can lead to increased processing times.
- Hallucinations: Like all large language models, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.6 can occasionally "hallucinate" or provide incorrect information, especially for ambiguous prompts or out-of-distribution inputs.
- Dependence on prompt quality: The quality of the model's output is highly dependent on the clarity and specificity of the input prompt. Vague or poorly structured prompts can lead to suboptimal results.
- Computational cost: Running the model, especially with video inputs or high thinking_budget , consumes computational resources and incurs costs. See the Thinking page for more details.
- Input types: See the following topics for details on limitations for each mode. Image inputs Video inputs Audio inputs
