This page provides suggestions for troubleshooting Google AI Studio if you encounter issues.
## Understand 403 Access Restricted errors
If you see a 403 Access Restricted error, you are using Google AI Studio in a way that does not follow the Terms of Service . One common reason is you are not located in a supported region .
## Resolve No Content responses on Google AI Studio
A warning No Content message appears on Google AI Studio if the content is blocked for any reason. To see more details, hold the pointer over No Content and click warning Safety .
If the response was blocked due to safety settings and you considered the safety risks for your use case, you can modify the safety settings to influence the returned response.
If the response was blocked but not due to the safety settings, the query or response may violate the Terms of Service or be otherwise unsupported.
## Check token usage and limits
When you have a prompt open, the Text Preview button at the bottom of the screen shows the current tokens used for the content of your prompt and the maximum token count for the model being used.
## Google Cloud IAM permissions for AI Studio
Members of a Google Cloud project need specific Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to perform actions in Google AI Studio. For more information about these identities, see the IAM principals overview .
Users with the Editor or Owner roles in the associated Google Cloud project have full permissions to view dashboards and manage Gemini API keys. Users with the Viewer role can view dashboards and API keys, but cannot create, update, or delete them.
For more granular control, refer to the following table for the specific permissions required for each AI Studio feature. For instructions on how to grant these permissions, see Granting, changing, and revoking access to resources in the Google Cloud documentation.

| Search project (import projects) | resourcemanager.projects.get |  |
| Rename project | resourcemanager.projects.update |  |
| Display quota tier | N/A |  |
| Create API key | Have Search project permissions, and: apikeys.keys.create serviceusage.services.enable iam.serviceAccountApiKeyBindings.create iam.serviceAccounts.create |  |
| List API keys | Have Search project permissions, and: apikeys.keys.list serviceusage.services.get | The Google Cloud project must have the Generative Language API enabled. |
| Rename API keys | apikeys.keys.update |  |

| Usage dashboard | Have Search project permissions, and: monitoring.timeSeries.list |  |

### Other access checks
In addition to Google Cloud IAM permissions, AI Studio also performs security and compliance checks. You might encounter a PERMISSION_DENIED or access restriction error in the AI Studio interface or in API responses if you do not meet the following requirements:
- Security checks: Your request must pass automated security checks.
- Terms of Service: You must accept the Google Terms of Service and Generative AI Additional Terms of Service.
- Supported region: You must be located in a supported region .
- Trust & Safety: The Google Cloud project must not be flagged for abuse.
