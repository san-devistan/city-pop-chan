When developing generative AI solutions with Gemini, Google offers two API products: the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API .
The Gemini Developer API provides the fastest path to build, productionize, and scale Gemini powered applications. Most developers should use the Gemini Developer API unless there is a need for specific enterprise controls.
Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem of enterprise ready features and services for building and deploying generative AI applications backed by the Google Cloud Platform.
We've recently simplified migrating between these services. Both the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API are now accessible through the unified Google Gen AI SDK .
## Code comparison
This page has side-by-side code comparisons between Gemini Developer API and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform quickstarts for text generation.
### Python
You can access both the Gemini Developer API and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform services through the google-genai library. See the libraries page for instructions on how to install google-genai .

### Other use cases and platforms
Refer to use case specific guides on Gemini Developer API Documentation and Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform documentation for other platforms and use cases.
## Migration considerations
When you migrate:
- You'll need to use Google Cloud service accounts to authenticate. See the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform documentation for more information.
- You can use your existing Google Cloud project (the same one you used to generate your API key) or you can create a new Google Cloud project .
- Supported regions may differ between the Gemini Developer API and the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API. See the list of supported regions for generative AI on Google Cloud .
- Any models you created in Google AI Studio need to be retrained in Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform.
If you no longer need to use your Gemini API key for the Gemini Developer API, then follow security best practices and delete it.
To delete an API key:
1. Open the Google Cloud API Credentials page.
2. Find the API key you want to delete and click the Actions icon.
3. Select Delete API key .
4. In the Delete credential modal, select Delete . Deleting an API key takes a few minutes to propagate. After propagation completes, any traffic using the deleted API key is rejected.
