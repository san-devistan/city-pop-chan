#### gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools
* For those building with a mix of bash and custom tools, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview comes with a separate endpoint available via the API called gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools . This endpoint is better at prioritizing your custom tools (for example view_file or search_code ).
Note that while gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools is optimized for agentic workflows that use custom tools and bash, you may see quality fluctuations in some use cases which don't benefit from such tools.
