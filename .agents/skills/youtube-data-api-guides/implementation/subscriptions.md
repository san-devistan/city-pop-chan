# Implementation: Subscriptions Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
## Page Summary
- The YouTube Data API (v3) allows retrieving a list of subscriptions for a channel using the subscriptions.list method, either for the authenticated user's channel (using mine=true ) or for another channel (using channelId ).
- To add a channel subscription, you can use the subscriptions.insert method, providing the youtube#channel kind and the target channel's ID in the request body's snippet.resourceId property, while also needing to be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
- Deleting a channel subscription involves first retrieving the subscription list using subscriptions.list to find the subscription ID, and then using subscriptions.delete with that ID to remove the subscription, which requires OAuth 2.0 authorization.
- The subscriptions.list method can also be utilized to retrieve a list of channels that subscribe to the currently authenticated user's channel by setting the mySubscribers parameter to true , while needing to be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
The following examples show how to use the YouTube Data API (v3) to perform functions related to subscriptions.
## Retrieve a channel's subscriptions
Call the subscriptions.list method to retrieve subscriptions for a particular channel. There are two ways to identify the channel:
- To retrieve the currently authenticated user's subscriptions, set the mine parameter's value to true . Note that a request that uses the mine parameter must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.subscriptions.list? part=snippet,contentDetails &mine=true
- To retrieve subscriptions for any other channel, set the channelId parameter's value to that channel's unique YouTube channel ID. The example below retrieves a list of channels subscribed to by the TED channel on YouTube. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.subscriptions.list? part=snippet,contentDetails &channelId=UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug Note: The API returns a 403 (Forbidden) HTTP response code if the specified channel does not publicly expose its subscriptions and the request is not authorized by the channel's owner.
See the subscriptions.list method's documentation for code samples.
## Add a subscription
Call the subscriptions.insert method to add a channel subscription. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. The request body is a subscription resource that sets the following values:
The snippet.resourceId.kind contains the value youtube#channel . The snippet.resourceId.channelId property identifies the channel that is being subscribed to. The property value is a unique YouTube channel ID. The channel ID could be obtained in multiple ways, including calling the channels.list method or retrieving search results for channels .
The API request below subscribes you to the TED channel on YouTube: https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.subscriptions.insert? part=snippet The request body is: { "snippet": { "resourceId": { "kind": "youtube#channel", "videoId": "UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug" } } } See the subscriptions.insert method's documentation for code samples.
## Delete a subscription
This example deletes a subscription. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. This example has two steps:
- Step 1: Retrieve the subscriptions for the authenticated user's channel Call the subscriptions.list method to retrieve the list of subscriptions. The example above for retrieving a channel's subscriptions explains how to make this request. The application calling the API could process the API response to display a list of subscriptions, using each subscription's ID as a key. In the response, each item's id property identifies the subscription ID that uniquely identifies the corresponding subscription. You will use that value to remove an item from the list in the next step.
- Step 2: Delete a subscription Call the subscriptions.delete method to delete a subscription. Set the request's id parameter to the subscription ID for the subscription that you want to remove. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. To complete the request in the APIs Explorer, you need to set the id property's value. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.subscriptions.delete? id=SUBSCRIPTION_ID
See the subscriptions.delete method's documentation for code samples.
## Retrieve a list of subscribers to the authorized user's channel
To retrieve a list of channels that subscribe to the currently authenticated user's channel, call the subscriptions.list method and set the mySubscribers parameter's value to true . The request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
