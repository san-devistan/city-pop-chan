# Implementation: Playlists Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
## Page Summary
- The YouTube Data API (v3) allows retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting playlists, with various methods for managing user-specific, channel-specific, or specific playlists.
- Managing playlist items, including adding, updating, and removing videos, is possible through the playlistItems resource, requiring the use of insert , update , and delete methods respectively, as well as knowing the playlist item ID.
- Operations involving playlist and playlist items often require an OAuth 2.0 authorization token, and certain actions, such as managing playlist images, necessitate media file uploads and cannot be fully tested in the API Explorer.
- Playlist images can be added, updated and removed by using playlistImages.insert , playlistImages.update and playlistImages.delete methods, but the last two cannot be tested in the APIs Explorer.
- Deleting a playlist requires first obtaining its ID via the playlists.list method and then using playlists.delete along with the ID, this same logic should be applied to the deletion of playlist images.
The following examples show how to use the YouTube Data API (v3) to perform functions related to playlists and playlist items.
## Retrieve the current user's playlists
Call the playlists.list method to retrieve the currently authenticated user's playlists. In your request, set the mine parameter's value to true . Note that a request that uses the mine parameter must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlists.list?
        part=snippet,contentDetails
        &mine=true
```
## Retrieve a user's playlists
This example retrieves the playlists created by a particular channel. The example has two steps:
- Step 1: Retrieving the channel ID Call the channels.list method to retrieve the channel ID associated with a particular YouTube username. (In this example, the username is GoogleDevelopers .) In the API response, the id property identifies the channel ID. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.channels.list? part=id &forUsername=GoogleDevelopers
- Step 2: Retrieving the channel's playlists Call the playlists.list method to retrieve the channel's playlists. Set the channelId parameter's value to the value obtained in step 1. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlists.list? part=snippet,contentDetails &channelId=UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw
## Retrieve information about a specific playlist
To retrieve information about one or more specific playlists, call the playlists.list method and set the id parameter to a comma-separated list of YouTube playlist IDs that identify the desired resources. A common use case for this functionality is a request to retrieve additional information about a group of playlists returned in a set of search results. For example, you might want to retrieve the number of items in each playlist.
The request below calls the playlists.list method to retrieve the number of items in two playlists that match the query term "GoogleDevelopers." This information is in the playlist resource's contentDetails.itemCount property, so the request sets the part parameter value to contentDetails . https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlists.list? part=contentDetails &id=PLOU2XLYxmsIIM9h1Ybw2DuRw6o2fkNMeR,PLyYlLs02rgBYRWBzYpoHz7m2SE8mEZ68w
## Add a playlist
This example calls the playlists.insert method to create a private playlist in the authenticated user's channel. Any API request to this method must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlists.insert?
        part=snippet,status
```
The link to the APIs Explorer also sets a parameter that specifies the body of the API request. The request body contains a playlist resource, which defines information like the playlist's title, description, and privacy status. In this example, the request body is:
```
{
  "snippet": {
    "title": "New playlist",
    "description": "New playlist description"
  },
  "status": {
    "privacyStatus": "private"
  }
}
```
The following example marks the new playlist as a podcast show:
```
{
  "snippet": {
    "title": "New playlist",
    "description": "New playlist description"
  },
  "status": {
    "podcastStatus": "enabled"
  }
}
```

## Update a playlist
This example updates a playlist's privacy status from private to public . The example has two steps:
- Step 1: Retrieve the playlist ID Call the playlists.list method to retrieve the playlists in the currently authenticated user's channel. The sample request above for retrieving the current user's playlists demonstrates this request. The application calling the API could process the API response to display a list of playlists, using each playlist's ID as a key.
- Step 2: Updating a playlist Call the playlists.update method to modify a specific playlist. This method requires a valid OAuth 2.0 authorization token. The request body must include the playlist resource's snippet part because the snippet.title property is required when calling this method. In addition, if the playlist resource being updated specifies values for the snippet.description or snippet.tags properties, those values must be respecified in the update request or they will be deleted. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlists.update? part=snippet,status As in the example above for adding a playlist, the link to the APIs Explorer sets a parameter that specifies the body of the API request. The request body contains a playlist resource, which defines information like the playlist's title, description, and privacy status. The following request body is used in this example: { "id": "PLAYLIST_ID", "snippet": { "title": "New playlist", "description": "New playlist description" }, "status": { "privacyStatus": "public" } } The following example marks the playlist as a podcast show: { "id": "PLAYLIST_ID", "snippet": { "title": "New playlist", "description": "New playlist description" }, "status": { "podcastStatus": "enabled" } } Note: If you are testing this query in the APIs Explorer, you will need to substitute a valid playlist ID into the resource body. To get a playlist ID, we recommend that you first run the request shown above for adding a playlist . Extract the playlist ID from the API response and use that value for the playlist you want to update. The playlist title and description used in this example are the same as those used in that example.
## Add a playlist item
This example adds an item to a playlist. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. This example has two steps:
- Step 1: Retrieve the appropriate playlist ID Call the playlists.list method to retrieve the playlists in the currently authenticated user's channel. The sample request above for retrieving the current user's playlists demonstrates this request. The application calling the API could process the API response to display a list of playlists, using each playlist's ID as a key.
- Step 2: Add a video to the playlist Call the playlistItems.insert method to add a video to the playlist. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. The request body is a playlistItem resource that specifies at least the following values: The snippet.playlistId identifies the playlist to which you are adding the video. This is the playlist ID you obtained in step 1. The snippet.resourceId.kind contains the value youtube#video . The snippet.resourceId.videoId identifies the video that you are adding to the playlist. The property value is a unique YouTube video ID. The API request below adds a video to a playlist. The request body is: { "snippet": { "playlistId": "PLAYLIST_ID", "resourceId": { "kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "VIDEO_ID" } } } To complete the request in the APIs Explorer, you need to set values for the snippet.playlistId and snippet.resourceId.videoId properties. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlistItems.insert? part=snippet Note: The documentation for the playlistItems.insert method identifies the other property values you can set when adding a playlist item.
## Add a playlist image
You can use the v3 API's playlistImages.insert method to upload a custom thumbnail image and set it for a playlist. In your request, the playlistId parameter's value identifies the playlist for which the thumbnail will be used.
This query cannot be tested using the APIs Explorer because the APIs Explorer does not support the ability to upload media files, which is a requirement for this method.
## Update a playlist item
This example updates a playlist item so that it is the first item in a playlist. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. This example has three steps:
- Step 1: Retrieve the appropriate playlist ID Call the playlists.list method to retrieve the playlists in the currently authenticated user's channel. The sample request above for retrieving the current user's playlists demonstrates this request. The application calling the API could process the API response to display a list of playlists, using each playlist's ID as a key.
- Step 2: Retrieve the items in the selected playlist Call the playlistItems.list method to retrieve the list of videos in the selected playlist. Set the playlistId parameter's value to the playlist ID that you obtained in step 1. Each resource in the API response contains an id property, which identifies the playlist item ID that uniquely identifies that item. You will use that value to remove an item from the list in the next step.
- Step 3: Update the selected playlist item Call the playlistItems.update method to change the video's position in the playlist. Set the part parameter value to snippet . The request body must be a playlistItem resource that at least sets the following values: Set the id property to the playlist item ID obtained in step 2. Set the snippet.playlistId property to the playlist ID obtained in step 1. Set the snippet.resourceId.kind property to youtube#video . Set the snippet.resourceId.videoId property to the video ID that uniquely identifies the video included in the playlist. Set the snippet.position property to 0 or to whatever position you want the item to appear (using a 0-based index). The API request below updates a playlist item to be the first item in a playlist. The request body is: { "id": "PLAYLIST_ITEM_ID", "snippet": { "playlistId": "PLAYLIST_ID", "resourceId": { "kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "VIDEO_ID" }, "position": 0 } } To complete the request in the APIs Explorer, you need to set values for the id , snippet.playlistId and snippet.resourceId.videoId properties. https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlistItems.update? part=snippet
## Update a playlist image
You can use the v3 API's playlistImages.update method to update the thumbnail image of a playlist. In your request, the playlistId parameter's value identifies the playlist for which the thumbnail will be used.
This query cannot be tested using the APIs Explorer because the APIs Explorer does not support the ability to upload media files, which is a requirement for this method.
## Remove a playlist item
This example deletes a video from a playlist. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0. This example has three steps. The first two steps are the same as those in the example above for updating a playlist item .
After completing those steps, call the playlistItems.delete method to remove a video from the playlist. Set the request's id parameter to the playlist item ID for the item you want to remove. This request must be authorized using OAuth 2.0.
Note that the playlist item ID used to identify a video in a playlist is different than the YouTube video ID that uniquely identifies the video. The playlist item ID identifies the video as an item in a particular playlist.
To complete the request in the APIs Explorer, you need to set the id property's value.
```
https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlistItems.delete?
        id=PLAYLIST_ITEM_ID
```
